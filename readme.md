## Motivation
I kinda like to play videogames and also I record every single game I play (mostly Halo CE), so I have a LOT OF HEAVY gameplays videos. My internet upload speed is VERY SLOW, It would take me 534 YEARS (no joke) to upload all my videos to youtube. I refused to the boredom of TRYING to upload to youtube years ago and recently decided to implement my own solution and this is the result.
